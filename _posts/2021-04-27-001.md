Ought to prevent the plague of worshipping at the altar of the apoltical. 

Must counter this incessant supression of the presence of the political. This itself is poltical, as is the supression. For... Politics is inescapable. Even as you are absorbed in a silent meditative fugue. Even when everyone involved gets their economic incentives aligned. Even if you do your part and leave the rest to the agreed upon protocol. Even so as we convince ourselves that it is a question of pure maths, just crunch the numbers rhetoric. 

Politics is inescapable. In life. In the bedroom. In the temple. In the market. In the mines. In the trenches. In your dreams. In the shower. In that loaf of bread you are holding, this screen you are looking at. 

Guess it's not what you think it is. Not what let's you justify your privilege of being able to say 'no' to politics.

Try to remember that time. You were sweating, getting all worked up, yelling to be heard, fighting, fighting. Fighting for justice. Out of nowhere, you got interrupted, stopped in the middle of your track. Got reprimanded for fighting, told you were being violent, that it is never worth it. Such platitudes blowing in the wind: *<br/>
Don't fight, become one with the universe. <br/> Turn your fights into games. <br/>Fights beget more fights. <br/>Be the change you wish to see in the world.* 

They ask of you, why you make everything so political, they say this with that  'I am apolitical' gaze. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#124; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You just want to punch them. 

Of course they are lying, they are acting ignorantly at the least. Their gaze is their politics.

And now for some theory behind some of these ways that the apoliticial plays out:

1. *The way of the one, aka the spiritual mode of apoliticizing* <br/>By framing a dichotomy between the outside as the political, and inside as the spiritual, or its variant, the temporary as the political and the eternal as the spiritual, or this variant of our differences as being behind the political, while our oneness as the spiritual, as bliss being our true nature and politics just ends up taking us away from it. We hear such phrases: you can always look for the world to be more fair, or you can just return to your mind, for that is the root of all your troubles; the world is the way it is, neither good nor bad, all is perception when you see it as otherwise; this world is but a temporary respite in your journey in eternity; seek to be one with the universe, in that all of the differences (among all those who do not agree or find each other disagreeable) dissolve. 

2. *The way of games, aka the economic mode of apoliticizing* <br/> By framing the political as a set of problems of the kind that could all be recast in its proper image, that of the economic realm. This is the claim that what looks like the political is actually the economic hiding, which is resting on the old Kantian metaphysical dichotomy of appearance-versus-reality where the political is made to be the former and the economic as the latter. This mode is particularly popular with the right wing libertarians who would want to utilize this mode for calling for minimal to no government, instead replacing all governance as a matter of economic design with mechanism design and other such microeconomics such as nudges and all. 

3. *The way of the meaningful, aka the semantic mode of apoliticizing* <br/> By framing the political as a set of problems which is stuck in an endless rut of repetition without end, thus, meaningless; for this to be true, it relies on the Sisyphusian logic that endless-repetition means it's meaningless. As a way of justifying this framing of the political, we will be reminded that in politics no problem is ever solved without raising other new ones, and that never is the case where a solution gets accepted by each and every member of the society, so its all a game of shifting symbols, priorities, and alignments -- *ultimately* meaningless. This mode suffers from the lack of acknowledging context as what gives meaning, instead it focuses on an absolutist sense of meaning that pervades irrespective of context -- this is the space of ultimate meaning -- here, the ultimate is seen as a final meaning, in terms of penultimate, here we see a conflation of time (penultimate as what comes last) with space (where each context is seen as cells in a the space that is the universe of possible meaning), here we see a dichotomy of the-~~pen~~ultimate-versus-the-contextual. 

4. *The way of the easy-virtues, aka the ritualistic mode of apoliticizing* <br/>  I do my part, I recycle, I donate my used clothes, I did sign up for causes of Change.org that one time or a few times in the last decade, I do my outrage on social media to stick it to The Man, I acknowledge pronouns, I buy organic and all local grown at that, am all about the First Amendment which I somehow think is synonymous to Evelyn Beatrice Hall’s “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it”, and I balance all that with such platitudes as “don’t over think it”, “listen to your heart”. Basically, easy virtues are an inexpensive source of karma credits (for I think _karma_ is some kind of a moral-existential credit system kept by the universe in my you-get-what-you-give vision of reciprocal cosmos).

For the neo-liberal subject who loves to shop online looking for the best deals for the latest gadgets and apps for every need/problem in life, who meditates every morning or at least casually agree to the scientic effectiveness of such endeavours, who thinks politics is such a drag, that government is a huge friction in business, that all of administration is glorified beauracracy -- these modes of the apolitical intersect to bleed through their actions, attitudes and arrogance. Such is the startup life.

There is politics in this reporting, in that one decided to make her look more Western, while another more Muslim, or so the narrative goes as what it constututes to belong one or the other identity. Even beyond the immediate, the politics lies in what it choose not to show, the identity it choose not to represent. This narrative is the implicit politics that remain inescapable.
