## TLDR: 
1. Death caps our time on earth. 
2. Death cancels our life. 
 
These ↑ two, very different realities, one of limiting a range (no more time as if time has a quantity, something to be measured), the other of vanishing/negating a presence (turning a yes ~~life~~ to a no ~~life~~ as if our life was but a mirage post death). You have been mistaking one for the other far too long! But nothing is ever that cut and dry, let's see how these two modalities of death play out inside each other... <br/> <br/>

Being obsessed with the time we have left, wanting to make the most out of our time, makes us want to chose automation over the manual, over the mechanical. Faster is better becomes our mantra. This unending drive to make the most out of the least, in terms of efficiency measures. Ultimately, comes down to us facing death in its inevitability, in its always-already-nearness. That which by its being cuts short our lives, limits the time we have left, makes us count the number of years left, sometimes over kind of years left. Time becomes -- a wholly numerically graded unit of seconds, minutes, hours, days -- as clock measurable time. This is the quantitative mode of our relationship to time, in how we live as residents in the measured times of our lives. Not the only way though. 

For once we die, there is neither more nor less time, but an absence of time. With that, automation, speed, efficiency makes no sense. At least, that is how we imagine our life when we won't be here. Does sound irrational, but we engage in such fantasies to make sense of the incalculable enormity of eternity before and after our brief, almost negligible, lifespan. Being taken over by images of eternity is of a different kind than the quantitative experience of time. It's a paradigm of binary truth, that there was life, not there isn't, and not one of how much life was there, that is in the qualitative mode. 

> I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.
> 
> <cite>-- Bhagavath Gita, [as quoted by Oppenheimer on the first successful nuclear bomb test].</cite>

Qualitatively, death presents itself to us as The One who negates our life, making us doubt if our life is but a mirage in the face of eternity of not being. Here we imagine a time when we are long dead, our specter floating far away in the universe looking back at the tiny speck of rock we call earth, and reminiscing our life, not being sure if it meant anything at all for how could it when it is, if at all, but a vague memory in the minds of those alive. 

Except for those few moments in the temporal thread that was our life, moments which light up in an otherwise fading line in a backdrop of utter darkness of not being, those moments which still shine through all of eternity, moments where love touched our soul, when passion overcame us together, when we were one with G-d -- Moments when how we lived mattered more than how much, a momentary production of high quality. 

Qualitatively, death presents itself to us as The One who negates our life leaving only those moments impossible to cancel, as when we were in the light of of all lights. 

These are those moods where life does not reveal to us so we can count it in how many seconds, hours, days together as one span, but as that blip of being in an eternity of not being, as a singular exception in what seems to be the norm, that of not being. No amount of counting the time we had makes up for it, in fact, no counting is possible as life has a sort of an unity, as that event which then happened, for once and ever to be so, never again. This is the qualitative mood through which death reveals to us the meaning of life facing an eternity of not being.

## Where the Quantitative & the Qualitative meet: That's YOLO ~~(many times over)~~

As long as we experience our life as a temporal range, we can still reason with it, bargain our time (as with a salary), there is the possibility of calculability with scarce resources. But with the qualitative, having an absence of time post death brings negates any calculability of time. 

In everydayness of life, its always a mixed bag. They are not exclusive, the quantitative and the qualitative. As when we dream, time moves differently, as when we get swayed with emotions and couldn't care less about what the clock says. Assuming if we were perfectly rational subjects, we would always be in the with the clocks, never getting carried away, is claiming that death will no longer present itself to us in its qualitative mode, which would be a highly irrational thing to believe in. 

As we save time by automating all boring tasks, to now have the free time so we can degen in some app doomscrolling for hours. Salary is a compensation for our ownmost time that we sell, but what would we have done with the time when we are reminded of our mortality as a friend passes away unexpected, maybe have a midlife crisis for a few lost years. Yes, and so the range and the binary constantly make each other, as we face eternity. 

Temporal scarcity captures only the quantitative play of death's engagement with time. Apocalyptic thinking, accelerationism, seeking for nirvana, pays tribute to the qualitative play for life and death.

The hyper productive person is overcompensating this incalculability by adding blinkers from seeing the approach of eternity. So is the life that is deeply measured in terms of trading one's time only for the best and the highest rated goods, tv shows, latest gadgets, most expensive luxuries of life, to the most miserly person saving up on all costs. The question, ‘who am I?’ gets transmuted to ‘how much am I?’ — in terms of net worth, value to my employer, number of friends on social media, follower count on Instagram, number of likes and retweets, number of steps walked today as per Fitbit. Life becomes a marketplace. Competing against each other is a proxy for trying to beat the pace at which death is approaching us. Markets are mortuaries as well. 

Those who degen, who are self destructive, would rather want to embrace the side of of dread of eternity -- instead of being forced into becoming absent by death, they want to invite it. Along with, comes a lot of dark currents in human behavior, not all evil, some mystical even.

> The Fear of Death is not an instinct: it is a reaction of the animal who is conscious enough to become aware of himself and his inevitable fate; so it is something we have learned. But exactly what is it we have learned? Is the dilemma of life-confronting-death an objective fact we just see, or is this, too, something constructed and projected, more like an unconscious game that each of us is playing with himself? According to Buddhism, life-against-death is a delusive way of thinking it is dualistic: the denial of being dead is how the Ego affirms itself as being alive; so it is the act by which the Ego constitutes itself. To be self-conscious is to be conscious of oneself, to grasp oneself, as being alive. (Despite all their struggles to keep from dying, other animals do not dread death, because they are not aware of themselves as alive.) Then death terror is not something the Ego has, it is what the Ego IS.

## The Existentialism of YOLO: Its unfairness & its Irredemability

At the heart of YOLO, is the affective realization that life is inherently unfair, for it comes with its own ending always already inscribed in it. This is not any road side unfair, but Unfairness Per Excellence, for whereever we go, our life goes, the unfairness keeps knowcking at us. If we listen too long to this knock, if we are unable to distract ourselves sufficiently, a desire starts creeping up inside of of us. That is the desire to destroy one's own life, at least that way one would have a certain level of control in the otherwise inevitable ending of all good things. 

If all good things must end, why not be one making that happen: being a irresponsible daredevil, hurting others, destroying social bonds, choosing a harsh ascetic life, the passion of Christ, Socrates not running away instesd thanking Asclepius for the poison, dying for a cause, being so dedicated in a serious work that it might not allow us to relax or smile or even kill us, seeking out NDEs when the "near" part is not guaranteed. 

> Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Do pay it. Don't forget.
> 
> <cite>-- Socrates' last words</cite>

At its base, there is a deep seated *dukkha* (anger? angst? despair? forlornness? not always in a negative sense, so much of existentialism) at the unfairness of having this one and only chance at eternity, this one life, to be negated soon, to realize it coming to an end. 

There's that anger out of the frustration at realizing that life, as the rarest of the rare events in an otherwise dead universe comes with its negation, its cancellation always already inscribed in it. So sometimes we end up lashing at others for all the wrong reasons, but mostly at ourselves in a fit of self destructive rage. 

Then there could be an urgent will to prepare as much as we can, evry second we are alive for that eternity is to be had with both arms embracing it. There could be whole set of attitudes that would seem counterintuitive to the unintiated in the occult art of thanato-logical life hacks. 

The theme of redemption is thus present in such a wide variety of religious themes, metaphors, myths in religions around the world, for redemption provides a framework to make sense of life's inherent unfairness of mortality, of time, of death, of the unknown other side. Another theme, that of cheating death is overwhelmingly present as well, as of baby Moses, baby Christ (even the adult one with the Resurrection), baby Krishna.

Redemption is not a *return* however, we are born anew once we cross over the other side having being redemed via a spiritual death. 

> Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”

## The Political Theology of YOLO: Accelerationism and Apocalypsism

In the socio-political spectrum, YOLO-dukkha continuum plays out in the accelerationist movements that has been prevalent under later modernity with Nick Land, Mencius Moldbug, Peter Theil et al. They want to accelerate the rate of growth in terms of capital acquirement, industry formation, but more importantly in terms of profit margins that adversely affect the Gini coefficient, the unrestrained spread and dominance of the computing paradigm via the cyberspace, the informationalizing of the human condition to turn everything exclusively in a game theoretic angle to be solved by the application of market design instead of moral and theological injunctions. They want to speed up capitalism to the point it finally breaks, thus eventually, turning its momentum against itself, in a mode of a critique of capitalism, as a post-capitalist form of Marxism. Marx's claim that capitalism is a necessary transition stage for communism to usher in, made the Soviet Union become an industrialized nation, and now its Western European and North American form, is turning capitalism more capitalist, one with no holds barred. They can be thought of as right-wing Marxists in that they are playing capitalism against itself. This amounts to capitalist techno-automation sans any speed limits so as to eventually exhaust the capital machine till it breaks down once and for all. 


> “God’s used imperfect people all through history. King David wasn’t perfect. Saul wasn’t perfect. Solomon wasn’t perfect,” outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in an interview on “Fox & Friends” before going on to claim that he had given the president “a little one-pager on those Old Testament kings about a month ago. And I shared with him, I said, ‘Mr. President, I know there are people who say, you know, you are the chosen one,’ and I said, ‘You were.’  [... It] demands a flawed secular hero as the champion. It therefore offers a model that allows the religious to cast secular political leaders as apocalyptic heroes, regardless of their personal failings. [... T]he framework of apocalypticism is a framework of hope: A dominant power group, feeling their power threatened, applies a prophecy from a time of similar power collapse to justify actions that range for immoral to unconstitutional via religious doctrine. [...] For Trump’s devotees, then, his failings are actually reason to be hopeful, if only because they suggest he’ll lead us into the world to come.
> <cite>Washington Post - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/26/apocalyptic-myth-that-helps-explain-evangelical-support-trump/">The apocalyptic myth that helps explain evangelical support for Trump</a></cite>

Accelerationism carries with it a religious history in the form of Apocalypse myths around the world. This is in the way some Evangelical fanatics act in destructive and violent ways to provoke a war among different faiths, to help politicians who deny climate change get elected, not not-knowing (as the Democrats of USA would like to think) rather precisely knowing so. In the hope and the promise that the Judgement Day will settle the score for they be the victors. The true test of faith is if we can receive the Judgement as a victory even when we loose the case for it is G-d that is judging us. 

(Judgement speaks to the theme of life's inherent unfairness in the way making it fair again as the ultimate just move)

Also, is at the heart of the ISIL raison d’etre of speeding up the coming of the final war at ‘Dabiq’ (a town in northern Syria, mentioned in a *hadith* about Armageddon) between the faithful and the infidels, and once they win, the apocalypse will commence.

## Pschoanalytic term for YOLO: Death Drive

Our wanting to have agency in our worst nightmares, *not inspite of, but because*, we are convinced of its inevitability is the source of the famous psychoanalytic term, death drive, embracing/enacting which, releases the weird sense of bliss of a limit experience in a movement of passion, or jouissance, at our release from being enslaved to our unquenchable thirst to live no more. These are morbid excitations, more stimulating than pleasure could stand, having to ground our enjoyment in a rigorous underlayer of friction — a fit of rage, wallowing in sorrow, righteous anger, flirting/crossing the line, extreme activities (sports such as bungee jumping, tourism such as Chernobyl trips, festivals such as burning man), watching horror movies when it will clearly disturb the quality of sleep after that, really deep tissue massage, making oneself wait for the fulfillment, staying in a job you hate just because you get to let of some steam from time to time, enjoying an intense workday as one ought to earn a living. 

Pleasure and pain are not mutually exclusive polar opposites, rather they are co-constitutive, which influences the way death and life are intermingled. Extremities make this apparent to us:

- for extreme pleasure can become unbearable, and in deep sorrow, we tend to discover a source of joy as when we surrender our fight against the concept of pain, it is the reality of pain that reassures us of our abilities to master over some of those fearful elements of life that we have long had escape fantasies about
- in extreme sports, being so as it risks the life of the player, bringing one close to death, ends up breathing new life to the player, and so is the case with extreme tourism.

So what has death got to do with pleasure-pain? Everything. Never leaving us. Like our lover who chooses us everytime before we could even pop the question.
