We are the Intropians, a critique of the extropian movement. 

Deriving from the word, ‘extropy”, extropianism, is a social movement premised on the continual expansion of the human lifespan. A core belief underlying extropian thinking is that advancements in science and technology will allow people to gain immortality. This movement has materialized around cryogenics and life-extension initiatives. 

The term, extropian came to existence as an antonym of entropy, in the latter’s sense of meaning disorder as it relates to being the cause behind the inevitable decay and death of all life forms. Thus, extropy comes with the promise of no-death by no-decay. 

This new term, "intropy" is derived from the PIE roots of "in" and "tropē" where the latter means "a turning, a transformation". So intrope could point toward the semantic cloud of such ideas as: turning inwards, an internal turn (an in-turn), a turn only for the insiders, a not so visible from the outside turn, turning within, an immanent turn, turning back its connotations to mean entropy (as it has the same PIE roots en+tropy via the Old French, "en" meaning “in”) all over again but only after having lost its entropic innocence at the hands of (having gone though the phase of) extropy. 

We bring forth a philosophy of, a provocation for inviting one more turn in thinking toward, around and against extropianism as it plays it in our world, especially in regards to the world of technology and tech-optimists, of which, *crypto* has been chosen to be a prime candidate for our analysis. The reasons will be clear in the next section.

## Encrypting death away

Extropy was coined by Tom Bell and defined by Max More in 1988 as “the extent of a living or organizational system’s intelligence, functional order, vitality, energy, life, experience, and capacity to drive for improvement and growth” In the *Principles of Extropy by* Max More, there is emphasis places on rational thinking and practical optimism. Extropians share an optimistic view of the future, expecting advances in computational power, life extension, nanotechnology and so on. Many extropians believe in a future where thanks to advances in biomedical technology, brain and bodies will be preserved by means of cryonics. 

It has been well documented that the history of digital cash (pre-Bitcoin) was influenced by the philosophy of the Extropians. Many of the early cypherpunks were committed to extropian ideals and experimentation. For example, Hal Finney,  who was deeply involved in the creation of bitcoin, to eventually received the first Bitcoin from Satoshi Nakamoto, had been diagnosed with *amyotrophic lateral sclerosis* (ALS) and was cryogenically frozen at Alcor Corps.

On a similar note, [Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has donated a substantial amount of funds to cryonic-oriented projects.](https://breakermag.com/the-bitcoiners-who-want-to-defeat-death/) On twitter, Buterin has known to have mentioned the fable of the Dragon Tyrant by [Nick Bostrom to promote life-extension efforts.](https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html#:~:text=In%20the%20fable%2C%20people's%20expectations,of%20human%20suffering%20and%20death.)

The progenitors of digital cash were one of the first few subcultures who started to question how a kind of money could hold its valuation into the future irrespective of nation states coming to or going out of power. In the sense of a money that never dies, this acts as an economic manifestation of their drive to gain immortality.  They wanted the value of money to never cease/die, so Bitcoin became an instrument that could store value “forever” — once saved, it would never get unsaved, and hence its unquestionable faith in the logic of immutability. 

Immutability provided for the economic justification behind immortality via funding for life extension research, to having the money to waking up to in the future once resurrected, to creating incentive compatible mechanisms that ensure that one’s cryogenic cell is maintained perfectly and eventually brought one back to life since the caretakers are due to receive the crypto that only the resurrected can unlock using keys from their memories. The rationale for immutability is in the theo-law-gic with regards to achieving immortality via resurrection.

This rationale is part of the larger system of belief that underpins extropianism in terms of a modernist project as evident in the movement’s preoccupations with “rationality” (game theory to solve world peace), “progress” (no time to waste, unless tomorrow is better than yesterday, it as been a waste), “expansionism” (spread crypto far and wide) and “individualism” (not your key, not your coin, instead of not your key, not your network) are one of the main driving factors behind this. 

In modernist conceptions of the universe, as with the majority of western metaphysics, time is perceived in a linear manner, which means there is no turning back time, hence the forward arrow of time — being immutable. In this light, immutability is cryptic for immortality. Applying the tech lens to encrypt our inherited desire for immortality, and out comes on the other end the crypt, the cypher~~punk~~, that is the immutability regime with its associated culture of guarding all past records with all your life, like from another time with the chosen guards at the ancient temple of Babylon. 

> [T]hat principally there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted. One need no longer have recourse to magical means in order to master or implore the spirits, as did the savage, for whom such mysterious powers existed. Technical means and calculations perform the service. This above all is what intellectualization means.

> [… F]or civilized man death has no meaning. It has none because the individual life of civilized man, placed into an infinite 'progress,' according to its own imminent meaning should never come to an end; for there is always a further step ahead of one who stands in the march of progress. And no man who comes to die stands upon the peak which lies in infinity. Abraham, or some peasant of the past, died 'old and satiated with life' because he stood in the organic cycle of life; because his life, in terms of its meaning and on the eve of his days, had given to him what life had to offer; because for him there remained no puzzles he might wish to solve; and therefore he could have had 'enough' of life. Whereas civilized man, placed in the midst of the continuous enrichment of culture by ideas, knowledge, and problems, may become 'tired of life' but not 'satiated with life.' He catches only the most minute part of what the life of the spirit brings forth ever anew, and what he seizes is always something provisional and not definitive, and therefore death for him is a meaningless occurrence. And because death is meaningless, civilized life as such is meaningless; by its very 'progressiveness' it gives death the imprint of meaninglessness.

With the loss of enchantment, death has lost any meaning, it is now a scientific and technical problem to be solved like all things the modern *man* has to solve.

## The path ahead

We recognize behind this assemblage of extropians movements lies dormant a deep desire, albeit faint in its expression, having been buried by years of getting older while fighting death in the process, working towards the impossible imaginary of immortality, that desire of finally, eventually, after all said and done, putting your guard down, to be able to slow down, take one’s time, smell the flowers, enjoy the sunset. The advantage of immortality over mere life-extension is in this certainty that you can directly/personally with im-mediacy ~~(transcending intermediaries)~~ benefit from whatever you do right then and there without having to wait for the fruits of one’s action post death, that every living moment would amount to living one’s “life’s work”. 

We keep reminding ourselves, what could seem like antagonistic to life, that being death, might be life fulfilling even and especially for extropians inspite of how extropians act and talk. Contradictions are abound when diving deep in life and beyond. If we are not running into contradictions, we are not paying close attention. Praying that this will humble us as we chart the Intropian path ahead.

We the intropians are interested in exploring how these multiple threads intersect with each other in order to sustain the reality that is the extropian movement. We, the intropians, invite you on a journey through the colorful lands of STS, anthropology, theology, and computer science to navigate the underbelly of this death defying dance that the extropians play.
