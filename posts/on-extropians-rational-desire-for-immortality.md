# Introduction

It has been well documented that the history of digital cash (pre-Bitcoin) was influenced by the ideas of the extropians. Extropianism, deriving from the word, ‘extropy”, is a philosophical branch that is premised on the continual expansion of the human condition. A core belief that underlines extropianism is that advancements in science and technology will one day let people live for an invariable amount of time. This for example has been seen in certain extropian commitments like: the freezing of human bodies under the anticipation that they will be resurrected in the future, uploading consciousness into a computer cloud, etc. 

It has been identified that many members of the early cypherpunks were also committed to these extropian projects and goals. For example, the famous Hal Finney, when he passed away, his body was cryogenically frozen by Alcon Corps. On a similar note, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, has donated a substantial amount of funds to cryonic-oriented projects. The goals of many crypto enthusiasts hence tend to overlap with extropian ones. One reason for this is that progenitors of digital cash (who were also extropians) were one of the first few subcultures who began thinking about how money could be transported into the future without losing store value. In other words, having a stable unit of value in some sense hints to a stable sense of self. 

Even though one cannot deny the important contributions of the extropian paradigm to blockchain culture, here we take a critical review of some of the extropian values that have been embedded into the technology’s design. To be more specific, we critically engage with one of the core values that underlies blockchain technology (immutability), relating this design principle to the concept of immortality. We mostly want to highlight that immutability is in some way, another word for immortality. 

What is the appeal for “immortality” for extropians? Or another way to ask this: why do extropians aspire or find some sort of appeal in the idea of living forever? We attempt to shed light on this question by arguing that the extropian obsession with “progress” and “evolution” has much to do with this. Western paradigms, especially extropianism is situated in a linear time perception that measures human “progress” in relation to technological progress. In other words, the more advanced a society’s or a culture’s technology is, the more it is deemed to be “evolved” or “progressive”.  In many ways, this kind of thinking captures the early European Enlightenment principles that were often predicated on positivist ontologies. In other words, what is considered to be “objective” must then be true. 

What we hope to shed more light on is the idea that behind the extropian urge to be faster, there is a rational desire to be able to slow down, take one’s time, and finally smell the roses. The advantage of immortality over mere life-extension is in the certainty that you can (~~finally)~~ directly/personally benefit from whatever you do that would normally be called a “life’s work”. This idea is explored through psychoanalytical theories related to human “death drive”.

# Immutability as Immortality

In the most present time, the best way to leave something created by humans that can survive their death is a technology that is shutdown proof, autonomous and in theory, lives independently and indefinitely — the closest candidate to that: the technology of blockchain. Marshall McLuhan a famous media theorist once stated that technology essentially needs to be recognized as an “extension of the human”. Cars are an extension of our feet, cellphones are extensions of our ears and blockchain can essentially be seen as the extension of the “temporal self” that lives on an immutable record forever, just as time itself is immutable since no one can turn back time and delete actual history IRL. Steve Jobs remarked on a similar idea to McLuhan when introducing Apple computers, using the metaphor of the “Bicycle”: 

“*The Computer is a Bicycle For Our Minds. ... the computer is the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with. It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds”* *- Steve Jobs* 

### Homo bots: Code never dies, so does our genetic code

Our identities are different online than in real life, for in the former we appear atemporal, disembodied, and faceless. Our online handles don't age like our body does, with wrinkles, grey hair, and other unpleasant deteriorations. As we project ourselves, displaced by our online identity, it is easier for us to conceive of each other as symbols on a screen, rather than living, breathing, organisms. We reduce our flesh-and-blood to a consciousness abstracted away into a symbolic system which could then be uploaded to the cloud. 

That I am not my digital avatar without a body, and all the biological joys that come with it, is clearly not realized by the Extropians. What if the handle I am talking to in a forum is all that they are, that is, it is just some symbols and code, with no flesh-and-blood person, what if we could become our own bots. Since code never dies, ourselves as bots wont either. 

Many blockchain aficionados, including the Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin himself, are affiliated with extropian projects and commitments. This obsession to expand the human condition can be understood from a psycho-analytical perspective. It has been well documented that individuals in technological communities, especially hacker ones, experience an existential dread that very often gets expressed as depression. In order to make meaning of their existence, these individuals are often driven by the need to “output”, seeing as how one’s lifespan is temporally limited by the event of death, one ought to optimize every task to ensure it is done in time, and eventually to fit it all in a lifetime. It is thus evident why individuals buy into the illusion that if one is able to expand their life, then one will accomplish what they want (their goals) by a few years and even up to infinity (aka immortality) and then at last this would allow them to finally find the peace of mind they have been searching for all along to do things without needing to hurry up like there’s no tomorrow. 

This is somehow perceived by the extropians to give life meaning; Steve Jobs’ famous quote about wanting to “make a ding in the universe” encapsulates this thinking well. What is ironic however is that behind the urge to be “faster”, there is actually a rational motif underlying, which has to do with the hope of finally being able to slow down and “smell the roses”. 

In other words, the desire for immortality is actually the search for some sort of “heaven” where one can slow down and savor time. We can understand this idea by aligning it with the Protestant Spirit and the concept of “Predestination”. Predestination is a concept that is predicated on the belief that by doing good deeds on Earth, one can go to heaven. Therefore, in the protestant ethos, time cannot be wasted and individuals are constantly outcompeting one other to supposedly reserve their spot in heaven. This is really not that different from the extropian ideology that similarly looks forward into time, believing that if one can accomplish as many good deeds as possible in their lifetime, they too can achieve some sort of state of equilibrium -  a state that in some ways frees us from the ongoing “death drive”. 


The specter of the scarcity of available-time, thanks to death, over the work which one thinks will save the world or as the work of one's life, haunts over our need for uber-optimization. Our hope for immortality, and henceforth, the search for it, provides the only way to circumvent it by making the available-time abundant, even always in-supply. We can also understand this impetus through the Freudian idea of the “death drive” that is intrinsic in all humans. The concept of the death instincts was initially described in *Beyond the Pleasure Principle,* in which Freud proposed that “the goal of all life is death.” In the most simplest terms, the ‘death drive’ is the drive towards death and destruction that is often expressed through behaviours like aggression, self destruction and repetition compulsion. This force, according to Freud, gets balanced by the “life instinct” that tends to human survival and self-preservation. These instincts are essential for sustaining the life of the individual as well as the continuation of the species. 

### Bored to Death

With the almost instant availability of everything, everywhere in the world, at the click of a button, thanks to the Internet and its ubiquity, there has been a change in the experience of the passing of time, even in our lifetime, especially as it relates to boredom. In this day and age, we have more and more active forms of boredom, as when we scroll down the phone screen without any interest on what's there and actually feel bored. Yet, we are unable to stop scrolling and look for something else that will interest us, for we are unable to spend the time to look for another activity and eventually do it long enough to fall in to liking it. Such as watching a Bergman movie or reading a Kafka unless we can somewhere time travel straight to the point in the movie where we are finally into it. 

No wonder,  *many see death as too sudden as they never lived enough in time to be able to face their death* with some level fortitude and fear. *The question is not whether there is life after death, but whether there is life before death.*  

In a life sans boredom, time gets flattened, just as we dont realize we have been on Facebook scrolling for the past 1 hour, or falling into a Youtube wormhole for 4 hours — Within a flat time universe, it is inconceivable that one can and will die, which is projected in the dream of immortality. Following is an excerpt from the book, “[Boredom Is in Your Mind: A Shared Psychological-Philosophical Approach](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030263942#:~:text=Boredom%20Is%20in%20Your%20Mind%3A%20A%20Shared%20Psychological-Philosophical%20Approach,research%20into%20one%20comprehensive%20resource.)” that connects boredom with the death drive,

Namely in blockchain incentive models, human behaviour is reduced to predictable and measurable variables, simplifying the inherent complex nature of human behaviour. For the extropians, which follow a positivist ontology, anything that is measurable and quantifying is seen as “true” and valued. 

[Someone who understands how blockchain incentive models please talk about it here]

The incentive design for Ethereum for example, follows a linear protocol and this is problematic. One can say that this is a practical stance, since only through these reductive categories can technology be effective and operational. For instance, uploading human consciousness into a cloud would prove to be undeniably complex if not impossible if all the variables that constitute the self were accounted for. Yet what we are not recognizing is the fact that cognitive frameworks are cultural-bound and language oriented. 

We thus have to ask ourselves, when we are dealing with “information”, which parts are being included/not included and what is the greater implication of this? 



# Part II: Why the Extropian Ideology is Problematic

When everything has been rendered so easy, so instant, nothing gives the feeling of actually having done it. This is epitomized, even glorified in the saying, "The best UX is no UX". As it's an automaton doing it on our behalf, it leaves us feeling devoid of any agency, makes us act mindlessly as if we are machines ourselves scrolling up and down. 

- we can act less responsibly, such when we troll "just for the lolz"
- we talk of ourselves in terms of being a machine: "by default", "chill mode", "hack it", "ping me"
- we start thinking of ourselves as extensions of these machines -- “Humans can *fly* now”, instead of saying, “we can operate a plane that can fly”

### Positivism as Colonialism 

There is indeed an ontological colonialism in blockchain communities. Nowhere has this been more evident than in Ethereum where some have witnessed the following double-standard: 
on one hand, social science research is encouraged, on the other hand, some research that is perceived to lack scientific rigorousness is downright considered too “wishy-washy”, “fluffy” “not backed by quantitative data”. 

It is understandable that developers who understand the world mathematically are more responsive to hard data backed research. The problem with such thinking is that it cuts out other forms of ontologies and knowledges. 

In other words, many hyper-extropians are in fact exerting a kind of ontological colonialism by discrediting other forms of knowledge. It is a symbolic act of western superiority that judges the world through the measure of technological progress. This is seriously problematic as all this is ensuring is power to the already powerful rather than empowering groups that actually need the technology. Positivism is not a  universal way of seeing things because language is symbolic. Positivism is still grounded in a western worldview of materiality and is still biased because it prevents us from seeing reality as it is. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“We follow all of these technologies, and many of the same people, into the hard-core utopianism of the Extropian movement. Extropians fused Austrian economic theories with new technologies and Bay Area techno-optimism to produce a model of transformation through speculative monies—from idea coupons to anonymous digital cash—that could be cryptographically authenticated, with their value backed by the very future they promised to bring about. They tried to accelerate the arrival of their utopia with a financial project to overclock human civilization.” (Fin Brunton, p. 118) 

The ranks of the Austrian economists and their interlocutors were varied. Ludwig von Mises, for instance, created an eccentric, convoluted theoretical framework called *praxeology*, which deduced all subjective human actions and de- sires from logical, axiomatic first principles, “not subject to veri- fication or falsification on the ground of experience and facts.” (p. 123) 

#### Are we all just Information? The Market and the Reduced Role of Human Agency

Neoliberalism theory, especially the Austrian school of economics has had a dominant influence on the cypherpunk culture. The high-tech Hayekians for example (like Philip Salin) who have adapted Hayek’s ideas into computations have been important figures in Silicon Valley culture.  Today, we are seeing how the high-tech Hayekian culture continues to permeate the lifeworld of developers, especially in Ethereum, currently engrossed in the development of decentralized finance (DeFi). 
  
 The Hayekian economics model (also known as Austrian economics): 

- There is a difference between neoclassical economics (that was inspired by hard science theories in physics) and neoliberal economics (begins in 30s. 40s) – the two started as separate
- Theory of knowledge is discovered, [Claude Shannon’s “Information theory”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), starts spreading into social science fields, especially economics, where economists pick it up and try to implement it 
- Neoliberalism starts with Friedrich Hayek – the first acknowledged economist who wants to elevate theories of “information” to the central role of economics (he wasn’t in favour of the neoclassical economics)
-  In Hayek’s unfolding theory, the role of human agency becomes diminished and considered less important than the market itself, which is presumed to be “all knowing” and smart than humans. 
- Hayek devises a “cognitive economics” - arguing that the market is not an “allocation” device but that on the contrary, it is “cognitive” (this is something no one has argued before). 
- This takes off, and the market according to Hayek’s doctrine becomes perceived as an epistemological machine, a model of the brain or an information processor. 
- The market, according to Hayek becomes understood as a powerful information processor than anything known to society
- The market essentially becomes framed as smarter than you; Hayek believes that there is information that humans can’t access but which the market on the other hand can
- All this gives rise to a kind of economics that diminishes human agency towards a kind  that solves problems by building markets (only market is recognized as competent) 

**Problem with Hayekian economics model:** 

- There is no single “monolithic” market as conceived in the neoliberal thought tradition, markets don’t do one single thing, they do many different things in many different combinations. 
- In this economic model, information is a commodity; if this is the case then cognition becomes irrelevant; it ignores thoughts and thinking since you cannot have a thought without a market in a neoliberal context 
- If the market is smarter than us, then we have to trust it because it allegedly knows than than its participants (us) - is this true? Markets can be wrong, but we never question it because the market is considered as “all knowing”. 

What does this have to do with Technology and Blockchain? 

Hayekian economics and its emphasis on information theory has entered into cyberspace, permeating the culture of Silicon Valley. One of the most prominent figures to date that has introduced and adapted Hayekian economic principles is [Philip Salin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Salin) - an Austrian school economists, known for founding the American Information exchange (Amix), a network for buying and selling information, goods and services. This gave birth to e-commerce, (buying and selling electronically), becoming the basis for enterprises like eBay and Amazon. This worldview paid attention of evolutionary processes, which is one of the reasons why Hayek’s work become so interesting to them because of Hayek’s interest in the evolution of knowledge. They became preoccupied with the evolution of ideas in society; this is where the term “marketplace of ideas” - interestingly enough, it did not originate from the Internet, but in fact, Hayek’s theory of information. This group would examine the history and the possible future of computer programming practices as illustrative of economic principles. They would see some of the problems that arise in human economic systems are analogous to problems in computational systems. 

Ideas related to high-tech Hayekianism became influential in cypherpunk circles. Today, these ideas continue to be espoused and encountered in contemporary blockchain projects and circles. In fact, they seem to have found a particular place in Ethereum and the advent of decentralized finance (De-Fi). 

High-tech Hayakianism suggests that all problems can be fixed with the implementation of proper market solutions. This is what many Ethereans believe (i.e.  [Glen Weyl’s Radical Markets](http://Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society)). Like economists, the market-makers aka developers in this case, in practice, are not neutral; they embody certain kinds of expert knowledge that often results in devising market solutions that skew the market in favour of specific actors. furthermore, the belief that any political or social problem can be solved via market reconfiguration or market building is problematic; since the market is seen as the perfect information processor (a giant computer), many things go unquestioned and with that the market itself, which can often times be flawed by failing to perform its intended purpose. 

**Why is thinking of markets as information processors problematic?**

Friedrich Hayek conceived of markets as information processors, presumed to be “all knowing”, essentially smarter than us, humans. Hayek’s economic principles, information as knowledge, eventually get translated into a belief system that increasingly starts to recognize everything as a computational process. 

If our cognitive processes function like computers, then our being is reducible to data. If everything is an information product and information is key to leverage and power, then this means that whoever controls the data flow also controls the market (i.e. Google controlling search information). For example, in the 1970s for example, IBM started gathering data to predict, people who had information were making immense amount of money. Information became a commodity. By inference then, as “data beings”, we too are manipulated and controlled. If the market knows more than we do, then we are not free to make our own decisions and decide what we desire; theoretically speaking, this means that these desires are defined by the market and then imposed on us. 

However, it is important to take a pause and wonder, are really just data? Even if we are quantifiable, what variables are we leaving out? What are we losing by focusing on one specific set of data and not another? What information intricacies are being filtered out/ejected from this “computation” ? What if the information we strip out/don’t use holds a kind of value that we are searching for? What f we are focusing on the wrong kind of information? 

Anuj: “In fact the more I think I have come to see "HODL"-ing is an extropian posture, even literally, "hold on for dear life" coz your life is immortal”

# Part III: Slow Down and Smell the Roses 

Extropian rationality is driven by maximum output, efficiency and optimization. One of the reasons behind this way of living is based on the belief that advantage of immortality over mere life-extension is the certainty that you can directly benefit from whatever you do that would normally be called a“life’s work”.

But one can extend their life by actually living in the moment and slowing down. this inherently changes the premise from “product-oriented” to a process-oriented” one, ensuring that greater care and quality can be given to a particular objective. We are not stressing that extropians must simply do the “opposite” of what they are generally accustomed to (that is speeding up and running towards a particular goal) but rather to cultivate a particular mindfulness towards that goal that can help achieve more successful and ethical technology in the end. 

As an alternative to the rational project of immortality, if one lived under a non-linear conception of time and movement, it actually opens up experiencing different lives in just one. For example, 
 non-linearity of hypertext allows us to read many text inside one (with hover text for example) -- [Hypertime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(philosophy)) is the alternative.  At the expense of: sacrificing the straight line that is necessary for progress, which means, there be no way to measure success in the name of progress, not in a one-dimensional arrow of time way, but more as a multi-headed demon, as a rhizome, a multiplicity.

# Extras

**Death is not a feature, but a bug**
Why do we need better phones every year? To what end does it all come to, apart from being an end in itself. If you are on a never ending drive to make everything faster, better, more useful, its only a matter of time when you chance upon a mirror and ask the same question about humans itself, are we not worthy of progress as well. One of the symptoms of this is, the emergence and popularity of life hacks. If you take this to its logical extreme, you end up asking why you’re not be able to find a hack to the final problem of death itself. Thus, *life itself has been framed as a product* *(fetishized)**, making death its ultimate bug, with diseases as minor bugs.*

**Why must the Internet outlast me**
We seem to be caught up in a worldview, that of the technological being everywhere all around us even in our watches and soon in our bodies as well, with a telos that is its own end: tech for the sake of tech. Technology makes us used to the phenomenon of a perpetual motion machine. Because automatic machines do run by themselves, for that is the meaning of auto + maton (“self moving, self willed”). We are surrounded by machines, as objects that move and do things, but that will survive our death, unlike the objects of the past which did survive, such as a painting, as they were static things. No wonder *we now feel envious of this special privilege of lasting our deaths that these moving machines of technology have and we don't*.  We even talk about our bodies as technology as well.

**The First Noble Truth**
If you had a magic device that would let you increase efficiency in everything and all things with no limits whatsoever, all you have to do is keep pushing the lever. This is the great underlying fear at the heart of all tech maximalists that they be making all of life so easy, so smooth, so solved, that living would become besides the point. 

As they say, "A good UX is no UX", a good life is no life at all. Like a machine, we be operating, no conflicts, no tensions, no doubts. 

> Elon Musk has to convince himself of the simulation argument, Vitalik hopes death be removed, Steve Jobs better believe he gets his Satori, Bill Gates has to solve poverty in India. Impossible dreams are the only cure.

If there be no friction in life, all was smooth, life be over in one instant. Sans friction, there be no rising of conscious attention, like a deep sleep eyes wide open, only to wake up at the moment of death. The First Noble Truth.
