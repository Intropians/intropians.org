## Take I. -- Living clockless, you feel the paranoia of being late, or too early <br/>
Soon you are no longer able to remember which day of the week it is. Essentially, you are stuck in a casino. Your entire world has been turned into one. Like a casino, you are under watch at all times. This is the world of cyberspace where we are perenially tracked a la the panopticomputer. This is the reality of prisons where we <i>do time</i> to kill time.

We get glimpses of this life-as-casino mood when you spend hours staring at the screen stuck in an infinite scroll on some social feed, getting carried away, not realizing its been four hours laying awake in your bed and it's time to wake up. 

### A world without clocks: Those weekends lost in one long <br/>Netflix binge with only toilet breaks and pizzas in between. 

That Monday when you woke up, got ready to leave for work, then suddenly found yourself asking yourself what happened to your resolution to be Internet sober; you made sure to quickly brush aside such dangerous thoughts by immediately reachng out to your phone.

In both cases, casino and being online, we are stuck in a prison outside of time where we are held hostage. The price we pay to be free is our capital: our money in the case of casinos and our personal data when we are online. So it is setup such that The House always wins, that the gamified apps eventually ends up making us give our data to it. What makes it difficult to resist is that our capital is hidden from us when we are in: those chips in the Casinos have no resemblance to a bill, and the interface of apps looks nothing to do with underlying data, just buttons and images.

### Take II -- But even in a world without clocks, we still have... <br/>
... those cigarette breaks at work. The regularity that it gives you, to stretch a little, to breathe deeply as you take each puff, to go outside, to gather with your cigarette work-buddy, the one you always have this ritual with, everyday, few times in the day. You don't need no watch to remind yourself, your body does it, something that escapes your conscious mind des it, you don't even think about, but you can not ignore it, as a robot, a machine that becomes you taking you out every few hours, in perfect synchrony with that other cigarette work-buddy. No words need to be sent over _Slack_ you two just know it, the bodies in harmony under that shared ritual, under the influence of the addiction. 

That repetition without any fail, thanks to the addiction, even though it is slowly killing you, works as the rhythm of the a clock that works towards your productivity at work, those breaks work well to clear your mind from the work at hand, just enough, for 5 minutes or so, not too much though, so when you get back to work, you are back to *work* the work. 

You get too wound up with work, with life, you light one up, lighten the tension a bit, look up at the sky pensively as you puff a circular smoke out, looking at your just-now creation of that circlar smoke, makes you chuckle for no odd reason, but that is distraction enough from what was worrying you. (distraction as that which gives you space from your own life, as you are lost in your distraction for that is distraction) 

That ritual, that you have to smoke every time you take a dump, or it would just not work. That look of I-know-you-are-smoker-too at a new workplace so you know you will see her at those regular breaks. That feeling when you have finally given up smoking after the 7th time of trying to give up, but saying to a smoker next to you, 'I don't miss smoking so, I miss the smell, I just love it, can I stand here next to you?'

## Take 0 -- Re/member those weekends lost... 
... in one long Netflix binge with only toilet breaks and pizzas in between. But thank g-d for those toilet, food and weed breaks: the clock strikes back in a world without clocks.

### We don't make clocks. Clocks make us. <br/>Inescapable. As is addiction.

Skipping meals for a day, then sitting on the table as the food is placed on the table, every second is a long wait. Finally gobbling it up, not really eating, as if its not about the taste but of quenching the hunder that's killing. That is a human being getting unwound just as the spring of a timer, all that tension built up, now finally getting released. 

Or an addict, so out of sorts when the time is up for the next hit, reduces to being a slave to the spring inside telling one to do everything it takes, irrespective of one's otherwise moral lever, to get the next hit. Addiction sets us up as if we are timers: the regularity of the hits, like a pendulum hitting sideways always in perfect harmony. 

So is it with Internet addiction: keep checking that phone, respond to every notification beep, asndwering to the hit as the potential for distraction is always there. Determines the pace of our lives these days.

Resistance becomes futile. Unwinding (the spring of the timer) is not so much doing as it is also undoing, making it difficult to resist. 

### Clock time moves from pendulum hits to hits.  <br/>Addiction time moves from hit to hit. <br/>Startup time moves from sprint to sprint, Workaholism 101.

Like the spring of timers, the instrumental mind gets so often wound up by the desparation to reach one's goal, that every thing that is done to get there gets framed as _merely_ a means-to-an-end. As if none of that had any value, only the end gave it meaning, if you didnt accomplish, might as well pretend you never tried. 

As if you are being pulled by an invisible string from the future coming from that imaginary end result that you so badly desire. Being on the path of your desire as you work towards your goal feels like a temporal spring being unwound. Reducing oneself as a timer in the world of desires to be met in a idealized future time. 

This is the person who is all about the end result at the cost of economizing every single detail of the process to get there, this person worships at the alter of lean processes as long as it guarantees the end result will be reached. So lean that all of the steps to get there is reduced to a minimum. The instrumental worker mind gets glorified there.

Startup sprints: Like a Spring catapulting the startup to its future goal. More like Startup springs.

### *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners do time. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guards do the watch. <br/>Watches show time. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bored kill time.*

Timers and/in watches are two sides of the equation that is the prison life.

Guards are aka prison _watches_; that word is also another name for a kind of a clock, one that we wear on us at all times so we do not loose sight of the passing of time. The panopticon of prisons conveys the same message of keeping the prisoner always-in-sight for the prison watch. The prisoner and the watch (the guard) together make up a clock of sorts, a territorial clock, where the measurement of time left on the sentencing being made into a question of confinement in space. 

- The prisoner gets dehumanized as being reduced to merely a timer: 'free when your time is up'. As if one's sentencing is the process of unwinding that spring of the (oneself acting as a) timer. 

- The prison guard becomes objectified as the watch. Both in terms of being the one looking/stalking/checkingupon the prisoner at all times to prevent disobedience or escape, and also acting as a timepiece, a watch when recognizing the need to keep the prisoner as long as the prison sentence is not over. 

To watch with the intention of never loosing sight is to make that person a prisoner of one's gaze. That is the reality of surveillance. The uses of big data, such as with targeted ads is the new form of eugenics. 

> Imagine if, during the Jim Crow era, a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers. <br/>
> Thatâ€™s basically what Facebook is doing nowadays.

### I am a prisoner of your gaze. <br/>I am a prisoner of your gaze... <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I can not see but you can. #Worse #Asymmetry<br/>I am a prisoner of your gaze... <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you can choose to watch me or not. #WayWorse #ParanoiaInducing

(Even for a watch, we just don't watch the clock, we listen to the tik-tok of the clock as well. Prisonwatches also listen to footsteps, murmurs, and gossip.)

Targeted ads, personalized search results, suggestion on what to buy next on ecommerce sites -- all of these reduce us becoming nothing more than timers, our sentencing: we are not free till we click on these ads, buy some of those suggested items, and do what is needed of us as long as giving our capital away to these platform watches. These tech platforms are prisons ~~(out)~~ of time.

We are wound up online -- doomscrolling, stuck in an infinite scrolling pattern, taking on all the clickbaits. When online, we become instrumentalized, as a mere means-to-an-end, but whose ends, not ours, but for the profit seekers cashing on all those algorithms -- our online presence is the instrument being played by the platform owners for their benefit alone. We are timers catering to the big data algorithms-as-the-watches that utilize those timers. 

### *HyperMedia = Internet of Springs <br/>Unwinding from one rabbithole to get wound up by another <br/>Just another binge, another doomscroll*
