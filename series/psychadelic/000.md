This is a personal blog where I engage with an imaginary audience as well parts of myself in a dialogue. I invite you to peer into my schizo reality. Please bear with me, it might get weird. 

Today I turned 29 and realized that this is the last year of my life that I will ever be in my 20’s. At this stage of my life, I am not sure whether to feel elated or scared. At 29, I still don’t know who I am or what I want. Yet,  I feel time speeding up more each year ,like the universe is about to warp itself. 

You know that feeling when you wake up and your mind becomes flooded with a million different things? Today, I woke up with with deep seated feelings of existential dread - this of course, isn’t anything new for me. I’ve learned to live with it. These feelings come and go, like the breath going in and out,  life and death. 

I am always in the process of dying, there is no single moment of “death” but death keeps happening to me now, as it is happening to you too. 

I lay in my bed thinking to myself: today, I am a year older. What have I accomplished? Such an extropian thing to think about. But all Intropians are to an extent extropian; it is never extropian vs. intropian, it is always extropian/intropian. These categories are never separate but are always enmeshed in relationship with each other, tugging and pulling at each other. 

To be intropian is to first of all, acknowledge the extropian in you. Today I acknowledge my extropian, accept it and  hope that in the next few years, I will be able to make peace with it. 

I’ve been so critical of myself, my work, my achievements; it never feel like they are enough, it never feels like I am enough…

In this culture that I am in, you can’t escape the fact that your self worth is always dictated and measured  by what you “do” . If you have achieved something spiritual like for example conquered a fear you had all your life, found your voice, had an intense breakthrough, these things never seem to matter. Your self worth is always defined by material means; how big your house is, the car you drive, how much you make. 
 
To feel worthy, you must look at your previous year’s calendar and review all the things you accomplished to feel good about yourself. But even then, all these things still make you feel lost and unwholesome. The extropian always spikes my adrenalin, making me jump up and yell, “holy shit, I need to do so much more”. 

I look at the 30-Under-30 and I look at the “movers and shakers on the world”. All these innovators, scientists, CEOS and CTOs under 30. It makes my head hurt. If you are a person who contribute to human “progress” then you are considered worthy, respectable, admirable. Your life and existence is worthy. Neoliberal market obsessions everywhere around me. Making human accomplishments into a market. We all fear death so time is of value, time before 30 years, for you might die any moment. Death is therefore a powerful driver of capitalist markets if not the most powerful one I would argue. 

Still, even knowing this, the extropian claws at my brain. Oh look, it’s Steve Jobs, oh wait…it’s actually demon Steve Jobs. This guy again….

Sometimes extropian energy manifests itself as Steve Jobs. it’s not my favourite manifestation frankly speaking. 

Demon Jobs creeps up to me and whispers in my ear: so, what have you done to make a “ding” in the universe in your 29 years?  (For those that may not know, making a “ding” in the universe is actually something Steve Jobs said)

Contemplating my life and trying to come to grips with this whole idea of “accomplishments” feels overwhelming. It makes my heart feel unsettled. That’s a heart I drew shaving itself to convey the feeling. Please, don’t ask why, emotions are complex and hairy.

Somehow to make my life worthy, to feel okay with my existence and to justify my death, demon Steve Jobs tells me I have to make some sort of “difference” in this world. 

But if I am going to die, what should it even matter…?

Luckily, the intropian energy form emerges, reminding me the following:

To be intropian is NOT to say “to hell with everything and the world, I’m going to die one day anyways so why bother making a difference?”, 

To be intropian is NOT to slip in the shadows of the world, to give up and lay low. 

To be intropian is to accept and embrace death while still remaining playful and curious. 

To be intropian to pursue your goals and achievements not just for the sake of justifying your existence because of death, but bringing light into the world because you know that any energy you put into the universe can never be destroyed. 

This is what it means to live a psychedelic life, an intropian life, a meaningful life. 

Intropianism is a patience that is aromatic and delicious, comparable to the experience of sipping fresh coffee on a Sunday morning while watching the sunrise. Intropianism is delicious, because it finds pleasure in savouring the experience of quality over quantity.

I despise the idea of “climbing the corporate ladder” with a passion. 

I always find this animation by the creators of South Park so accurate in critiquing the absurdity of corporate culture.

After I worked at my office job for a year, I got very depressed. I knew something was not clicking with me and that the whole corporate lifestyle 9-5 was never going to work out for me. 

When I was growing up, money was really tight and I faced a lot of pressure because I didn’t have the luxury to go “soul searching”.  It was extremely hard and nerve wrecking to step out of the corporate lifestyle but in the end, miraculously, I managed to do it. It was hard needless to say, but it is a moment I will always remember. it was the moment when I gained a sense of control and power. 

To be intropian is to trust yourself and everything around you. To be intropian is not to believe in a “g-d” but to believe in yourself because you are g-d. Once you realize that you have the power to make your own choices, you become unstoppable. Let you mantra be “I can” and see where it takes you. 

Some of you might feel be feeling exactly I am now; feeling trapped. Constantly feeling like you are living a life that you didn’t choose for yourself. You were always doing the “right” thing, following the good advice of others. Now you’re stuck and you feel numb, miserable. You’re not living your most authentic life and you know time is slipping away more each day. Yet you continue to operate in auto pilot mode. 

If you want to live a psychedelic life, it all starts with courage.
    
1. To live a psychedelic life, one must first and foremost have courage. This means rejecting the dominant narratives you have been taught both in school and by your family (especially in relation to the meaning of success”. How many times have we heard, “if you study hard, you can get a job and make lots of money”. Money is neither good or bad, it is a technology. Money is freedom, yet we are never taught that we should treat our relation to money as a means to an end rather than end itself. 
2. Embracing uncertainty. To walk the intropian path, one must carry themselves with passion and conviction in what they do. Sometimes it can mean not knowing what you’re doing and being okay with that. It is a improv-figure it out as you go driven process. Learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. 
3. Embracing non-identity and being okay with “no-self”

As a PhD student, I face a lot of pressure to perform “well”. For example, there is a constant need to demonstrate your achievements on your CV in order to get grants and funding. Your work is constantly ranked, and people always look at how many publications you have put forth. Yet, there is always someone out there who is going to be better than you; someone who has more publications, more conferences, awards etc. Liberal arts program are critical of capitalism but they are really no different; they engage in the same practices and mechanisms, quantitative measuring systems, competition. They complain about “the patriarchy” yet they endorse the same models, masculine dominant energy of performance, competition, doing-doing-doing, racing to the end. Like a conveyer belt, we go through academic milestones, factory logistics all the way. 

I am tired of being defined by what I do. If I define everything according to my work, my material achievements, I still feel like I have nothing to hold onto because it is a fleeting feeling. There is that brief ‘aha’ moment and then it’s gone. I always need to perform more more more and still, I am left feeling empty and unfulfilled. 

To be intropian is not to reject the act of “doing” and “acting”, to be intropian is to understand that through your acts, you achieve spiritual growth and wisdom which you put out in the world through your work and energy. 

## To live a psychedelic life in an intropian way is to: 

walk away from the act of defining your personhood through ~~language.~~ 
<pre>
    It is to embrace your whole, celebrating 
    the undefined,  a kind of open system 
    that makes itself open to receiving. 
</pre>
Having the courage to step outside of yourself and embrace moments of insanity. 

<pre>
                            to acknowledge 

that the individual
 mind is //////////fractured/fractured/fractured (“I AM” FRACTURED)
 into many realities. 
                           & Embrace schizophrenia by understanding that reality is split open into many as it lives through each individual mind. 
                           A “Schizo-reality.” 
                           We 
                            are not schizo but reality
                              is and 
                                we are just 
                                   the subjects…..
</pre>
##                             helping reality realize                     that it’s always been schizophrenic and we are the therapists 🤡

                            
Just look at the proliferation of "who knows what’s real anymore?" with conspiracies, covid, global warming, mainstream media, and all that — people live in many realities, some parts of which overlap with each other. 

To be intropian  is to have COURAGE and to step away from everything you think makes you “you”, to embrace the emptiness of your self, your nothingness, for that is what you are, YOU ARE NOTHING. Take that as a compliment. There is nothing more liberating than knowing this. 

Because if you are nothing, you are free and when you are free, you can build yourself in the way you want to build yourself. 

You don’t need to have an identity. You are free to be what you want without schizoreality dictating who you are on your behalf. 

Finally…

To be intropian is to embrace vibrant colours. Beautiful radiant colours that inspire and breathe life into the very core of your existence, feeding your will and purpose, reminding you that creativity and curiosity is your birthright. 

Now go play.
